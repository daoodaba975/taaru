2. Open the forked repo in your terminal and run `npm install`
3. Open the repo in **VS Code**
4. Launch your command palette `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` and type **VSIX**
5. Select the one that says **Extensions: Install from VSIX**
6. Load the **VSIX** file you created a few steps back
7. Go to the debug sidebar `View → Debug`
8. Hit the green arrow beside "Launch Extension" - opens a new window
